This program illustrates some of the main features of Python. 
First, whitespace is used to nest lines of code, thus the line starting with if falls inside the scope of the previous line starting with for; 
this ensures that the ing test is performed for each word. Second, Python is object-oriented; 
each variable is an entity that has certain defined attributes and methods. 
For example, the value of the variable line is more than a sequence of characters. 
It is a string object that has a "method" (or operation) called split() that we can use to break a line into its words. 
To apply a method to an object, we write the object name, followed by a period, followed by the method name, i.e. line.split(). 
Third, methods have arguments expressed inside parentheses. For instance, in the example, word.endswith('ing') had the argument 'ing' to indicate that we wanted words ending with ing and not something else. 
Finally — and most importantly — Python is highly readable, so much so that it is fairly easy to guess what the program does even if you have never written a program before.
